# software-quality-seminar

This repository contains my work from the TUM seminar **Software Quality**, which was held during the summer semester 2020 by the chair for Software and Systems Engineering (Prof. Pretschner).  

It includes the seminar paper I wrote, the corresponding presentation and the tool I implemented.  
My topic in this seminar was **Maintainability of Java Methods: A Quantitative Approach**.  
For a quick overview of my work, take a look at the presentation slides.
